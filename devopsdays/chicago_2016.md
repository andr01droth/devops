*My very first devopsdays.*

__tl;dr GET YOUR ASS TO A [DEVOPSDAYS EVENT](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/)!__

I very much appreciate that this conference spotlighted culture as much as technology.  Running themes included __empathy, inclusion, diversity, continuous learning and sharing, humane software, vulnerability, humor, compassion, and courage__.

The venue was a nice layout and great location.  The meals were good and the refreshments were readily available.  The organizers and volunteers were enthusiastic, patient, and helpful.  Many many thanks to them!  My favorite parts were the Ingites.  I had never experienced them live before and it was awesome (as were all the keynote speakers).   As for the participants - so many people (but not too many), so many perspectives, so many different places along the devops journey(s)!  

The vendor space was contained and not all up in your face.  The vendors themselves seemed like good peeps (special thanks to [@xebialabs](https://twitter.com/xebialabs) for the prerelease copy of [The DevOps Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002) and to [@signalsciences](https://twitter.com/signalsciences) for the bottle of scotch).

#### [DAY 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9wBgFEnWjY):

The event kicked off with a presentation by [@adamhjk](https://twitter.com/adamhjk) entitled _The Evolution of Automation_.  This was the perfect setup for the next two days as it really set the vibe for a cultural conference more than a technology conference. And to his credit about context, I am stuck with a memory of his family's waterlogged six-flags adventure - and that sweet sweet wolf shirt.  I am because you are. When you suffer, I suffer.  When you thrive, I thrive.

The next presenter was [@\__jvasallo__](https://twitter.com/__jvasallo__).  Joel walked us through what he calls _The Five Phases of DevOps_ (a nod to the Kübler-Ross model).  What I found most striking about this presentation was 1.) this was his first time presenting  and 2.)  his excitement and enthusiasm were palpable.   He provided relatable content about his ongoing experiences within his company's devops journey.

_How Is The Role of Devops Changing In a Serverless Environment?_  That's what [@jedberg](https://twitter.com/jedberg) was asking.   Jeremy talked about his company's move to AWS Lambda, the challenges that it presents, and some of the ways it will necessarily shape and transform devops.   I hope Jeremy has this all worked out by this time next year, or, more importantly, before any company I work for goes all-in on serverless!  Homework:  read about cumulative flow diagrams.

The next presentation I am calling "I am not alone in the universe," but it was actually called _Fear and (Self) Loathing in IT – A Healthy Discussion on Imposter Syndrome_.  [@OakParkGirl](https://twitter.com/OakParkGirl) spoke directly to my soul with this one.   It turns out, a great many of us feel like frauds sometimes.   I feel like a benevolent universe conspired to bring me here just to hear this message!  I don't know how many times I have thought I might be George Costanza'ing my way through my career.

[@alison985](https://twitter.com/alison985): _Ways Devops Could Be More Accessible_  
Enable others. Everyone is a teacher.

[@hpuxgirl](https://twitter.com/hpuxgirl): _What's That Creature Living In My Cloud_  
A fresh look at pet vs. cattle.  Teacup pigs & barn cats!!!

[@jamfish728](https://twitter.com/jamfish728): _Out of the Basement: Demystifying Security and Operations_  
Contagious energy. Security is not the enemy. Challenge operational stereotypes!

[@rmillerwebster](https://twitter.com/rmillerwebster): _Building Resilience In Our Organizations, Our Teams, and Ourselves_  
"Trust is the willingness to risk being vulnerable." Repair trust.

[@DarkAndNerdy](https://twitter.com/DarkAndNerdy): _Dungeons and Dragons... And Devops_  
Dope AF.  Please write a book.  I will be waiting.

__Open Spaces:__

Okay, so this is where I had some problems.  Mostly my own because I am extremely introverted, but I think there could be some logistical  improvements (encourage open doors, use the big room for multiple spaces).   

The "Open Spaces"  were physically closed off, so once I found myself sort of blocked in from a closed door -- I never left.   I am sure it is my own hangup, but I felt like moving myself across a crowded room (excuse me, pardon me, excuse me) and opening a door to leave would be too disruptive.  Likewise, the idea of opening a door and maneuvering around to an open spot in a room would also be disruptive.   

My only other Open Spaces exposure involved learning about open spaces, so there was a bit more coaching and corralling (note takers and the like).  It also involved physically open spaces - which I found to be easier to negotiate.

#### [DAY 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9bY-R_pNoM):

[@jilljubs](https://twitter.com/jilljubs) kicked the day off with _DevOps'ing Recruitment_.  It was good to hear about the hiring struggles from a recruiter's perspective. Many unicorns and rainbow shits in the deck.  There was a very poignant slide dealing with the perception of the recruiter process.  Main take away for me:  empathy in all interactions.

Next up was [@bjhaid](https://twitter.com/bjhaid) with _Lessons Learnt From "Shipping" Containers_.  Another impressive first time speaker who was also  on fire with enthusiasm and energy.  The content here was technical and but highly relatable; I went through this same Docker ecosystem learning process at my previous job.

[@nellshamrell](https://twitter.com/nellshamrell) gave us _Untangling Infrastructure Code Through Refactoring_.  Unfortunately, I got caught up in the hallway track and missed a sizable chunk.  When I came into the preso, we were well into the refactory.  What I did see was an awesome demo of TDD practices being applied to Infra as Code.  I look forward to watching the video.

[@bhenerey](https://twitter.com/bhenerey) had the pre-lunch slot and presented _Leading an Enterprise to the Public Cloud_.  His stories of dealing with his parent company were very funny.  I basically had a running Dilbert stream in my head playing out his interactions with the enterprise.  He ran out of time in the end (which he had prepared for).  I would like to see the whole thing.

__Open Spaces:__

Before Open Spaces, the vendors announced their raffle winners and  __I won a bottle of Scotch!__  Thanks, [@signalsciences](https://twitter.com/signalsciences).

I watched the taping the of Arrested DevOps Podcast and then I had to catch a train back to St. Louis.
